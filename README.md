# PivotTableWebGenerator
Generates an HTML Page from a table.

This is the very first version. The CSS Generator is up yet; I am unsure how exactly to prodeced with it.

Also, the testing program is very good right now, it is very ad hoc. I think in the final product we will have proper file I/O system.
This is good enough for now.
